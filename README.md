# GLBIO_2017
Matchmaking in Bioinformatics session @ GLBIO2017

Session description:  The MiB@GLBIO session (Matchmaking in Bioinformatics, BTW) will have a series of quick talks about specific tools and resources, followed by  “speed-dating” time (hence, the matchmaking theme), where tool developers/analysis experts will briefly interact with bench scientists/novice researchers to determine whether future conversations/collaborations are useful and whether they have interests in common. Major topics of broad interest, such as RNA-seq isoform specificity, Chromatin Accessibility, and Evolution, will be included.

Organizers: Ewy Mathé (ewy.mathe [at] osumc [dot] edu), Helen Piontkivska (opiontki [at] kent [dot] edu), Ben Busby (ben [dot] busby [at] nih [dot] gov)

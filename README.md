Brief session description:  The Matchmaking@GLBIO session (Matchmaking for Computational and Experimental Biologists Session) will have a series of quick talks about specific tools and resources, followed by  “speed-dating” time (hence, the matchmaking theme), where tool developers/analysis experts will briefly interact with bench scientists/novice researchers to determine whether future conversations/collaborations are useful and whether they have interests in common. Major topics of broad interest, such as RNA-seq isoform specificity, Chromatin Accessibility, and Data Integration, will be included.
